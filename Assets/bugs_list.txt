Metadata

Dialogue
* When you load a file, the background option does not update UNLESS you've already entered into the scene (fixed)
Characters
* When you add a new character under metadata with pre-existing character packs, multiple packs will get added (fixed)
* After duplicating a new character, it seems like the character changing settings won't work unless you go back.
